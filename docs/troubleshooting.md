# Troubleshooting

Concrete diagnostic flows for the most common failure modes when running Hermes WebUI. Each entry has the symptom, the diagnostic commands you should run *before* opening an issue, and the fix that has worked for past reporters.

If your symptom isn't listed and the diagnostics don't narrow it down, file a bug at https://github.com/nesquena/hermes-webui/issues — include the relevant command output after redacting secrets, private paths, full `.env` files, full `auth.json` files, cookies, tokens, and password hashes.

## Requests succeed but access records disappear during agent work

The server emits `[webui]` JSON access records to its original process stdout,
using a private duplicate captured before agent imports. This keeps request and
HTTP error logs visible when an in-process tool redirects or closes `sys.stdout`.
Logging failures still must not interrupt HTTP responses.

Check the service's captured stdout (for example, `docker logs <container>` or
the journal for your WebUI unit). Verify successful `POST /api/chat/start` and
`GET /api/chat/stream` records, not only health probes or rejected requests.
Records include `method`, `path`, `status`, and `ms`: elapsed time until response
headers, **not** the lifetime of an SSE stream or the agent turn. A missing record
before response headers does not distinguish a pending request from a logging
failure. Keep the launcher's output destination open for the process lifetime.

Scheduled cron execution belongs to the Hermes Agent gateway scheduler, not the
WebUI HTTP server. Investigate cron outcomes in the gateway's logs and the
active Hermes home's `cron/executions.db`; WebUI access records show HTTP cron
management requests, not every scheduled execution.

## "AIAgent not available -- check that hermes-agent is on sys.path"

**Symptom.** WebUI starts, shows the chat interface, but every chat request fails immediately with this error in the response or the server log. As of v0.51.6 the error includes a diagnostic block with the running Python interpreter, the relevant `sys.path` entries, and the most-common fix; on older versions the message is bare.

**Why it happens.** The WebUI imports the agent class at chat time via `from run_agent import AIAgent`. That import only succeeds if the running Python's `sys.path` contains either the hermes-agent checkout or a pip-installed copy of the agent. Three common failure modes:

1. **Agent installed but not on `sys.path`.** Most common. The agent is checked out somewhere (e.g. `~/Programmes/hermes-agent`), the WebUI was launched with a Python that doesn't know about it, and there's no `pip install -e .` linking the two.
2. **Symlink with a typo or wrong target.** A symlink to the agent looks correct on `ls`, but `readlink` resolves to a path that doesn't exist or doesn't contain `agent/__init__.py`.
3. **`HERMES_WEBUI_AGENT_DIR` set to the wrong directory.** Override env var beats auto-discovery and points at a directory that has no agent code.
4. **Agent installed as root, under the FHS layout.** When the Hermes Agent installer runs as root on Linux it places the agent at `/usr/local/lib/hermes-agent` (CLI linked into `/usr/local/bin`), not `~/.hermes/hermes-agent`. Older `bootstrap.py` didn't probe that path, so it built a WebUI-only `.venv` and failed at launch with **"Python environment cannot import both WebUI dependencies and Hermes Agent."** `git pull` to update the WebUI (current `bootstrap.py` auto-discovers the FHS layout and follows the `hermes` launcher to the agent), or set `HERMES_WEBUI_PYTHON=/usr/local/lib/hermes-agent/venv/bin/python` and relaunch.

### Step 1 — confirm the agent location

```bash
# If you have ~/hermes-agent (the default location):
ls -la ~/hermes-agent
readlink ~/hermes-agent          # if it's a symlink, where does it resolve?
ls ~/hermes-agent/agent/__init__.py 2>&1
```

The third command must succeed (the file must exist). If it fails, your symlink is broken or pointing at a directory that's missing the agent module — fix that first.

### Step 2 — confirm the WebUI is using the right Python

```bash
cd ~/hermes-webui && ./start.sh 2>&1 | grep -iE 'agent|python|hermes_webui_python' | head -20
```

The startup banner prints which Python and agent dir it resolved. If the agent dir is empty or the Python is the wrong one, set the override:

```bash
export HERMES_WEBUI_AGENT_DIR=/absolute/path/to/hermes-agent
export HERMES_WEBUI_PYTHON=/absolute/path/to/agent/venv/bin/python
./start.sh
```

### Step 3 — install the agent in editable mode

This is the most common fix and resolves the original issue #1695:

```bash
cd /path/to/hermes-agent          # the directory holding pyproject.toml + the agent/ module
pip install -e .                  # use the same python that runs the WebUI
```

Then restart the WebUI:

```bash
cd ~/hermes-webui
./start.sh
```

### Step 4 — verify by importing manually

If steps 1-3 still don't work, check whether the WebUI's Python can import the agent at all:

```bash
$HERMES_WEBUI_PYTHON -c "from run_agent import AIAgent; print('ok')" 2>&1
```

(Replace `$HERMES_WEBUI_PYTHON` with the actual Python path from step 2 if the env var isn't set.) If this prints `ok`, the agent IS on `sys.path` for that Python — and the WebUI should work.

If this fails, `import run_agent` itself is broken — check that the agent's pyproject.toml lists `run_agent` as a top-level module or that the agent dir is on PYTHONPATH:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=/path/to/hermes-agent $HERMES_WEBUI_PYTHON -c "from run_agent import AIAgent; print('ok')"
```

If adding PYTHONPATH fixes it, persist the path either via `pip install -e .` (preferred) or by setting `HERMES_WEBUI_AGENT_DIR` to that directory.

### When to file a bug

If after running steps 1-4 the import still fails *and* `pip install -e .` succeeded *and* `PYTHONPATH=... python -c "from run_agent import AIAgent"` succeeds — that's a real WebUI bug. File at https://github.com/nesquena/hermes-webui/issues with:

- The output of every command in steps 1-4
- The full diagnostic block printed by the WebUI's `ImportError` (v0.51.6+)
- Your OS, Python version, and how the agent was installed

## "Response interrupted." marker keeps saying "no agent output was recovered"

**Symptom.** After a live response stream stops before a turn completes (manual restart, OOM, crash, browser/SSE disconnect, lost worker bookkeeping, …), the affected chat shows an `**Response interrupted.**` marker. If the run-journal for that turn is already visible on disk, the marker says the partial output was recovered; if not, it preserves the user turn and says no agent output was recovered yet.

**Why.** Sidecar repair re-checks the run-journal after it detects a stale stream and uses the result as a one-shot signal. On WSL2 (9p / DrvFs) and on some network-backed setups, the run-journal `.jsonl` is written by the stopped worker but the WebUI process reads it through a page-cache state that has not yet seen those writes — recovery returns "empty" and the marker would otherwise be baked permanently. The fix introduces a *lazy* retry path: when sidecar repair cannot read visible output but knows the stream id, it stores a `_pending_journal_recovery` flag on the marker and re-attempts recovery from `get_session()` until the journal becomes readable (or the retry budget is exhausted).

**Interruption classes.** The WebUI now keeps the user-facing cases separate instead of implying every stale stream was a restart:

- **Browser/SSE connection interrupted** — the live browser `EventSource` transport dropped. The UI reports `Connection interrupted` and tries status/replay/session restore before showing the final browser-side notice. Chat and gateway SSE errors also POST a small sanitized diagnostic event to `/api/client-events/log` (source, session id, stream id, readyState, visibility, online state, path without query string) so server logs can distinguish browser transport loss from backend worker loss.
- **Lost worker bookkeeping** — the stream id is gone and the worker registry no longer has an active run. Recovery markers carry `interruption_cause: "lost_worker_bookkeeping"` and `/api/chat/stream/status` reports `terminal_state: "lost-worker-bookkeeping"` for non-terminal journals that are no longer active.
- **Stream/run split-brain** — the stream is gone but `ACTIVE_RUNS` still lists the worker. Recovery markers carry `interruption_cause: "stream_run_split_brain"` so the transcript says this is a bookkeeping split-brain rather than a restart.
- **Process crash/restart** — `SERVER_START_TIME` is newer than `pending_started_at`, meaning the WebUI process started after the turn began. Recovery markers carry `interruption_cause: "process_restart"` and explicitly say the process-start evidence points to a crash or restart.

**Diagnostic.**

The on-disk locations below assume the default `~/.hermes/webui` state directory. If you override it via `HERMES_WEBUI_STATE_DIR`, substitute that path for `~/.hermes/webui` in every step.

1. Identify the affected session id and stream id from the marker. The marker JSON lives at `~/.hermes/webui/sessions/<sid>.json`; after the fix it shows them on the `_journal_retry_stream_id` key. Pre-fix sessions only carry the legacy wording, with no retry meta.
2. Check whether the run-journal contains real events:
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.hermes/webui/sessions/_run_journal/<sid>/<stream_id>.jsonl
   head -2 ~/.hermes/webui/sessions/_run_journal/<sid>/<stream_id>.jsonl
   ```
   If the file exists and contains `token` / `tool` events, the lazy-retry path will pick them up the next time the session is opened.

**Fix.** Reload the session in the browser. On the next `get_session()` call the marker is re-evaluated; if the journaled events are visible on disk the marker promotes to *"The partial output above was recovered from the run journal …"* wording and the journaled assistant text + tool cards land above the marker in chronological order. No manual sidecar editing is required.

**Trigger.** Sidebar metadata polling is intentionally not enough to run this self-heal. Requests such as `/api/session?messages=0&resolve_model=0` load the session with `metadata_only=True`, skip the full messages array, and therefore skip the lazy journal retry helper. Click/open the affected conversation so the message panel performs a full `messages=1` load; that full render is what re-checks the journal and can promote the marker.

**Caps.** The lazy retry path gives up after 12 failed attempts or 24h of wall-clock age, at which point the marker is demoted to a neutral *"Partial output may have been lost."* wording so the "reload to retry" prompt doesn't linger forever for genuinely lost journals.

**When to file a bug.** If, after the fix, you see the lazy-retry wording (*"Recovering the partial output from the run journal — reload this session to retry."*) but reloading the session never promotes it to the recovered wording even though the `.jsonl` clearly contains `token` events, capture the marker JSON and the run-journal file and file a bug.

## "Context compression exhausted" after a long-running turn

**Symptom.** A long-running session, often with many tool calls or a small
context-window model, ends with a `Context compression exhausted` error instead
of a final answer. The message includes a recovery action labeled `Start focused
continuation`.

**Why.** Automatic compression could not shrink the current conversation enough
to continue safely in the same model-facing context. The exhausted session is
terminal: sending a bare "continue", "go on", or "继续" would usually replay the
same oversized state and fail again, so the WebUI points the user to a focused
linked continuation instead.

**Diagnostic.**

1. Open the session JSON under your WebUI state directory, for example:
   ```bash
   jq '.recommended_recovery_action, .compression_recovery' \
     ~/.hermes/webui/sessions/<session_id>.json
   ```
2. A recoverable exhausted turn should report:
   - `recommended_recovery_action: "start_focused_continuation"`
   - `compression_recovery.terminal_state: "compression_exhausted"`
   - the final assistant error message carrying `_compressionRecovery`

**Fix.** Use the `Start focused continuation` action in the exhausted message.
The new linked session preserves the workspace, model, profile, project, and
toolset lane, but intentionally starts with an empty model-facing transcript so
the oversized exhausted tail is not replayed. After the new session opens,
describe the next narrow task explicitly instead of sending a bare continuation.

**When to file a bug.** File a bug if the exhausted message has no recovery
action, the action creates a session with the old oversized context/messages
replayed into the model-facing transcript, or a bare "continue" starts another
turn in the exhausted session instead of being blocked with recovery guidance.

## Installed PWA opens to a blank screen after an update

**Symptom.** The installed PWA or home-screen app opens to a blank screen after a WebUI update, while the same URL often works again in a normal browser tab.

**Why.** Reverse proxies are supported, but proxy basic auth can challenge the same-origin `sw.js`, manifest, or versioned `static/*` fetches the installed app needs while its service worker updates the shell.

**Diagnostic.**

1. Open the same WebUI URL in a regular browser tab and confirm whether it loads there.
2. Check reverse-proxy logs for `401` responses on `/sw.js`, `/manifest.json`, or versioned `/static/*` assets during the update.
3. Temporarily remove proxy basic auth and use WebUI's built-in password. If the blank screen stops after the next update, the proxy auth challenge was the trigger.

**Fix.** Prefer WebUI's own password for installed PWAs. If you keep proxy basic auth, configure it so the same-origin service-worker and shell update fetches can complete. If the installed shell is already blank, clear site data for the Hermes origin, then reopen or reinstall the PWA after that site-scoped cleanup.

**When to file a bug.** File a WebUI bug if the blank screen still reproduces without proxy basic auth, or after the proxy allows the same-origin service-worker and shell update fetches through.

## "Hermes Agent was updated while Hermes WebUI was running"

**Symptom.** An action that uses the in-process Agent runtime stops with a message telling you to restart Hermes WebUI manually. This can happen after `hermes update`, a Git checkout/pull in the Agent source tree, or another tool updates Hermes Agent without restarting the already-running WebUI backend.

**Why.** WebUI imports `run_agent.AIAgent` into its long-lived Python process. Continuing after a known Agent Git revision changes could combine cached modules from the old revision with source read from the new revision. Local Agent-backed actions return a retryable `409 agent_runtime_stale` with `restart_scheduled: false` before accepting a new turn. Gateway- and runner-owned chat keep their existing runtime ownership. Non-Git Agent installs preserve their existing behavior because there is no revision identity to compare; losing a previously known revision remains fail-closed.

**Diagnostic.** The stale-runtime response includes `agent_update_state`, also preserved in asynchronous compression error status:

| Value | Observation |
| --- | --- |
| `active` | A recent Agent update marker names a live PID. |
| `incomplete` | An Agent recovery marker exists in the loaded checkout or configured venv installation. |
| `stale` | The update marker names a dead PID or is older than the diagnostic age limit. |
| `unknown` | Marker contents, PID liveness, or recovery-marker presence cannot be read or classified. |
| `unverified` | No active or recovery marker was found. Update completion and environment health remain unverified. |

These are observations, not success receipts. Hermes Agent removes `.hermes-update-in-progress` on failed and interrupted exits too. A missing or stale marker, or a readable Git revision, does not prove a completed update or a healthy environment. WebUI only reads these markers; it does not remove or repair them.

**Fix.** Check the Agent updater's outcome and resolve any failed or incomplete Agent update first. Once the Agent checkout and environment are healthy and no updater is running, restart WebUI using the same launch method that started it:

```bash
./ctl.sh restart
# Or, for a user systemd service:
systemctl --user restart hermes-webui.service
```

For a foreground `python3 bootstrap.py`, stop it with Ctrl-C and start it again. Restarting the whole computer or WSL is not required when restarting the WebUI backend succeeds. Retry the action after restarting the backend; refreshing the browser alone does not replace its imported Agent modules.

**Automatic restart prerequisite.** Revision mismatch does not schedule a WebUI restart. Safe automation requires an Agent-owned terminal success receipt bound to the exact update transaction, final revision, and healthy environment, plus an Agent-owned atomic handoff or lease that excludes new mutations across process replacement (or an Agent updater that performs the restart itself). No such public contract is verified for this integration. Repeated readiness checks followed by `os.execv()` leave a race; WebUI's own update lock does not exclude an external Agent updater. Explicit updates initiated through WebUI retain their existing behavior and are outside this revision-mismatch guard.

**When to file a bug.** File a WebUI bug if the restart-required message appears even though the Agent revision did not change or become unreadable, or if a clean WebUI restart still produces the same import error. Include the launch method, WebUI and Agent revisions, the marker diagnostic, and sanitized error text.

## Agent sessions list slowly (or the `state.db` read index is missing)

**Symptom.** The sidebar's imported/CLI session list takes seconds per refresh on a large Hermes profile, or a log line says a `state.db` read failed. Sessions still appear; nothing is lost.

**Why.** Every WebUI reader of the agent's `state.db` (session listing, transcript reads, lineage, gateway watcher, cron sidebar, insights, health) opens it strictly read-only (`file:...?mode=ro`). A reader never upgrades to a write-capable handle and never creates an index: on a multi-GiB `messages` table `CREATE INDEX` holds the SQLite writer lock for minutes and stalls the agent streaming into the same WAL database. When the agent's standard `idx_messages_session` index is missing (older agent, hand-rebuilt or re-imported DB), listings degrade to a bounded one-pass pre-aggregation — slower than the indexed seek, but read-only. A read-only open failure propagates to the caller's existing error boundary (the listing returns empty for that profile) instead of silently reopening the file writable.

**Diagnostic.**

```bash
sqlite3 "file:$HOME/.hermes/state.db?mode=ro" "PRAGMA index_list(messages)"
```

`idx_messages_session` should be listed. If it is not, the agent has not created it and WebUI will not create it for you.

**Fix.** Create the covering read indexes in an explicit drained maintenance window: stop the agent (and any gateway/cron runner) writing to that `state.db`, then run:

```bash
python3 scripts/ensure_state_db_read_indexes.py --db ~/.hermes/state.db --confirm-drained
```

- `--confirm-drained` is mandatory: it is your assertion that no agent turn is running against the database. The tool does not verify it.
- `--lock-file PATH` (optional) additionally holds an exclusive non-blocking lock on `PATH` (`flock` on POSIX, `msvcrt.locking` on Windows) for deployments that serialise agent turns on a lock file; a held lock makes the tool exit without touching the database. Without `--lock-file` no lock primitive is required, so the script runs on native Windows as well. On Windows the lock covers byte 0 of `PATH`; a new or empty lock file is initialised with one byte first (an existing lock file is never rewritten).
- The tool opens the database `mode=rw` (never `rwc`): a mistyped path raises instead of creating an empty database. Indexes are created inside one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction and rolled back on any error.
- It is idempotent and prints a JSON status per index (`created` / `existing` / `skipped`). `skipped` means this database's schema lacks a column that index keys on (an older agent); the indexes the schema does support are still created. An existing index with a different table, key shape or collation is reported as `Incompatible index` and never replaced; an index that is not covering (`EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`) is reported as `Index is not covering`.
- Windows UNC profiles (`HERMES_HOME=\\server\share\...`) are supported: readers and this tool build the empty-authority URI `file:////server/share/state.db` that the bundled SQLite accepts.

**When to file a bug.** File a WebUI bug if the listing stays slow after the tool reports `existing` for `idx_messages_session`, if the tool reports `Incompatible index` on an untouched agent-created database, or if a read-only open fails on a local path. Include the tool's JSON output, the `PRAGMA index_list(messages)` result, and the sanitized error text.

## 404 after login when password auth is enabled

**Symptom.** After enabling password authentication (`HERMES_WEBUI_PASSWORD`), logging in redirects to `/sessions` and the browser shows a `404 not found` error instead of the chat interface.

**Why.** The server-side redirect after login targets `/sessions` (plural), but that path was missing from the explicit SPA-shell allowlist in `handle_get()`. Without auth the bug is invisible because the SPA handles `/sessions` client-side and the server route is never hit — only the server-side post-login redirect exposes it.

**Fix.** `/sessions` is now included alongside `/` and `/index.html` in the set of paths that serve the SPA shell. No configuration change is needed.

## "OpenCode Go model picker shows a model that errors when you send" (or is missing newly released models)

**Symptom.** One of two directions:

1. A model selected from the OpenCode Go group fails on the first message (`model not found`, `Model is unavailable`, or a region error), even though the picker offered it.
2. A newly released OpenCode Go model does not appear in the picker at all, and must be typed into the Custom Model ID box.

**Why.** The Go picker follows the **live** Go-tier catalog (`https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/models`) whenever the installed Hermes Agent is v0.20.5 or newer. That endpoint advertises a superset of what a given tier, key, or region can actually serve — an id can be listed and still fail on send. Conversely, an id the endpoint serves but the WebUI's static fallback list predates is missing when the live path is unavailable (Agent older than v0.20.5, probe failure, or offline); the static list mirrors Hermes core's curated Go catalog and can lag new releases by design.

**Diagnostic.** Check which path is feeding your picker:

```bash
hermes --version          # live path requires >= 0.20.5
curl -sS https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY" | head -50
```

Interpret the two together:

- **Failing model absent from the `curl` output** → it was delisted upstream (for example `ox-alpha-free`, removed from the relay on 2026-09-09). A picker can still offer it from a **stale catalog merge**: Hermes core merges its own curated Go list into the live result, and every Agent release *through v0.21.1 (tag `v2026.9.7`)* still carries the delisted id in that list — verified at runtime against v0.21.0, where the live path serves 37 ids including `ox-alpha-free`. The removal is committed on core `main` (2026-09-09 sync) but **no released Agent version includes it yet** — and `main` reports the same `0.21.1` version string as the stale tag, so a version number alone cannot tell you whether the fix is in. Until a release notes the 2026-09-09 catalog sync, the **verified workaround is the config allowlist** (below); selecting the dead entry is harmless to other models (it errors on send, nothing else).
- **Failing model present in the `curl` output** → the relay lists it but your tier/region cannot serve it; the picker is behaving correctly. Pin the models you actually use with an explicit allowlist in `config.yaml`, which takes precedence over both the live catalog and the fallback:

  ```yaml
  providers:
    opencode-go:
      models:
        - kimi-k3
        - glm-5.3
  ```

  A lighter per-provider exclude capability is tracked in #7507.
- **Missing new model, Agent ≥ v0.20.5** → the live catalog is the source; refresh or check the endpoint with the `curl` above (cold rebuilds are also bounded by a 4-second foreground budget — the first picker open after a restart can serve the last-known list while the live rebuild finishes in the background, so re-open the picker once before concluding it's stale).
- **Missing new model, Agent older than v0.20.5** → the static fallback is serving by design; upgrade the Agent to ≥ v0.20.5 so the picker reads the live catalog.

**When to file a bug.** File a WebUI bug if a model fails on send *and* appears in the `curl` output for your key (a routing problem), or if a model is missing with Agent ≥ v0.20.5 and the live catalog reachable (fallback used when it should not be).
